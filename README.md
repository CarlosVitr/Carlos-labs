This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
Create a Next.js app

To create a Next.js app, open your terminal, cd into the directory you’d like to create the app in, and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example " https://github.com/CarlosVitr/Next-site-blog "
```

Under the hood, this uses the tool called `create-next-app`, which bootstraps a Next.js app for you.It uses this template through the --example flag.`nextjs-blog` is a name of the directory you can put your name on.If it doesn’t work, please take a look at this page.

Run the development server
You now have a new directory called nextjs-blog.  Let’s cd into it:

```bash
cd nextjs-blog
```
Then, run the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
#or
yarn dev
```
 This starts your Next.js app’s "development server" (more on this later) on port 3000.

 Let’s check to see if it’s working. 
First, run the development server:



Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
